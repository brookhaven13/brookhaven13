## 🚀 Hey there, I’m @brookhaven13

A frontend engineer with 5+ years of experience who enjoys building clean, delightful, and well-structured web applications.
Recently, I’ve also been diving deeper into backend development—creating my own API services using Golang and Node.js.

### 👀 What I’m passionate about

💻 Crafting modern, intuitive UI/UX for real-world products

✨ Building full-stack side projects, especially APIs & tools that make life easier

🔍 Writing clean, maintainable code—always following DRY, BEM, and clear architecture principles

### 🌱 Currently exploring

Golang backend development, focusing on API structure, performance, and deployment

Node.js project architecture, from routes to services to DB layer

Improving my full-stack workflow and DevOps fundamentals along the way
